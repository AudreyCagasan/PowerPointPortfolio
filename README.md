# PowerPointPortfolio
This is my PowerPoint portfolio.

My PowerPoint for Boba Phone Bank was created for my previous position as a data associate for the Asian Community Development Council. This presentation was to guide both staff and volunteers through the process of signing into ThruTalk for our Get Out To Vote (GOTV) Campaign. During GOTV, we held 3 phone banks. and I was tasked to understand how to use the website, create an informative PowerPoint, and to train volunteers and staff if we had a surplus of volunteers.
